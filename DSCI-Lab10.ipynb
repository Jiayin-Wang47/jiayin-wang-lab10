    "- You will be given the lab assignment in the start of the lab. You're supposed to complete it by the deadline stated on DEN. Should be usually on Friday Midnight.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- You've to complete the assignments individually. If you are having trouble completing the assignment do let me know, I will clear your doubts and guide you but I'll not write code for you and no one else should :) !!!  \n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to fill in the code to this notebook and upload it to your repository. And simply, submit the link to the repo (which has all the lab submissions inside it). I know the link would be same over the submissions, but it's a simple way to map you on DEN and Github. Also, the jupyter notebook file name has to be in the form '(First name)-(Last name)-lab(Lab Number)'. All characters in lowercase. For example, first lab for me would be 'dhrumil-soni-lab1'  \n",
    "\n",
    "- You are encouraged to look up resources online like python docs and stackoverflow. But, you are encouraged to look up the topics and not the questions themselves  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Your last submission will be counted towards your grade on DEN and do not edit the repository after the deadline  "
